The purldb 
================================
This repo consiste of two main tools:

- MineCode that contains utilities to mine package repositories
- PackageDB that is the reference model (based on ScanCode toolkit)
  that contains package data with purl (Package URLs) being a first
  class citizen.

These are designed to be used first for reference such that one can
query by purl and validate purl existence.

In the future, these will be used as reference for dependency
resolution, as a reference knowledge base for all packag data,
as a reference for vulnerable range resolution and more.
